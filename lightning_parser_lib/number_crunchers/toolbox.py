def zig_zag_range(max_value: int, start: int):

    Generates an iterator over indices in a zig-zag order within the range [0, max_value).

    The iterator starts at the specified `start` index and then alternates between
    increasing and decreasing indices. The pattern is:
    
        start, start + d, start - d, start + 2*d, start - 2*d, ...

    The initial direction is chosen based on the available space toward the range
    boundaries. If the distance to the upper boundary (max_value - 1) is smaller than
    the distance to the lower boundary (0), the iterator will first move upward; otherwise,
    it will move downward.

      max_value (int): The exclusive upper bound for indices (valid indices are 0 to max_value - 1).
